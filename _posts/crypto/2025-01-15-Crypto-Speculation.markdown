I have always been a huge believer in the idea that Cryptocurrencies represent the future, always enamored by the way these currencies were able to capture a huge portion of the market within a small time, with Bitcoin recently crossing 100k and the celebrations that occured within the community after that something clicked within me, the idea that Bitcoin had simply become a stock that was used by investors to increase their monetary holdings and by traders to bend the markets using market psychology and in that sense the only thing that differentiated it from the stock market was the technology/idea behind the coin itself.

Some people were proudly comparing the cost of Bitcoin from 10 years ago and how it would have made you so rich had you bought it then, but what they fail to understand is that the inception of Bitcoin was done not to be used as a speculative commodity but as a currency itself and in that sense it seems to have failed. Think about it this way, if you took a dollar from 2015 and put it in a piggybank and if you broke the piggybank today, would the dollar have changed. I agree that inflation may cause the amount of things that you can buy with the dollar to change but the dollar still remained a dollar and that is the point, had the bitcoin been used for the purpose it was intented to it wouldn't have mattered what it's price in dollars was.
Bitcoin was originally meant as a nemesis to the dollar and to centralized exchanges, however now it has been pegged to it and is one of the many commodities that can be traded with it, this is the reason why I drew the analogy to the stock market because in a way that is exactly what happens on the stock market as well.

Now think about it this way, say you went to the store and bought jeans worth a 100$ now when you go to the storekeeper you say " I will give you a 100 shares within this company", now the storekeeper may or may not buy this depending on the stock value of the company as well.

Another reason people state about how Bitcoin would be the future is the fact that huge financial companies have adapted it, but one must remember one thing that for these companies the reason for entry was not the technology or the growth Bitcoin promised but the simple fact that a lot of retail investors were putting in their money in it and there is a quote about the sharemarket that can be applied to any other markets as well that goes something along the lines of "The market exists to move money from the impatient to the patient" and for huge companies Patience is never an issue simply because of the huge gap that exists between them and the others. 

Note that in no way, I am stating that the idea behind Bitcoin was weak and I still believe in it's potential however what enrages me is that the Bitcoin has just become another commodity and any sort of exchange based on the Bitcoin would simply be speculation.

Besides there is another issue that would be central if we wish to make Bitcoin an exchange currency,
